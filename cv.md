My goal is to gain programming skills as a web developer. Then I'd like to find a job as a programmer.

      let strNew = ["#"];>
      let n = cc.length-5;>
    		  
      if (cc.length>4) {  
    	 for (let i=0; i<(cc.length-5);i++){ 
    		 strNew[i+1] = strNew[i] + "#"; 
    	 }
    	 let strNewOll = strNew [n] + cc.substr(-4, 4);
    	 return strNewOll;
      }
      else {
    	return cc;
      }
    }
